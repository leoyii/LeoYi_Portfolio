            <p>ICS4UO ISP final project. Our project is called Seeking Elysium and it is meant to educate kids between ages 12-15 about surviving addictions, which is a social issue. It is important and significant because many kids around this age start to get exposed to types of addiction such as internet and game addiction. It is also good to educate them early about drug addictions and such, so that they are more aware and knowledgable in the future.<br><br>Made By: Leo Yi and Glen Lin.</p>
