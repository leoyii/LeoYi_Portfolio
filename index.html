            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Leo Yi, I am a MaCS student at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I.
                I am very passionate about STEM and music, as shown in my hobbies and accomplishments. My favourite animal is the capybara and my favourite food is pocky.
            </p>
            <br><h4>Extracurriculars and Hobbies</h4>
            <p>I am a proud member of the Mackenzie Science Club, Linguistics Club, Business Council and Pokemon Club at our school.
                Outside of school, I take weekly cello lessons at the Toronto School of Strings and Piano. 
                I have been playing the cello since 4th grade of elementary school and plan to continue to do so until I graduate. 
                I have also been a member of the Mooredale Senior Strings Orchestra for about 3 years.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my favourite pastimes include: playing video games, chess, and reading. In my free time, I also enjoy watching anime, which is a type of japanese cartoon.
                I am also a keyboard hobbyist, as I enjoy playing around with/tinkering with mechanical keyboards.
                While doing work or when I'm feeling stressed, I listen to music, mainly hip-hop and rap, but sometimes pop. 
                Some of my favourite artists are 21 Savage, J. Cole, Drake, and Kanye.</p>

            <br><h4>Accomplishments</h4>
            <p>I have a black belt 2nd dan in Tae-Kwon-Do. 
                I also received first class honours for my grade 7 and grade 9 RCM exams for cello.
                I have participated in the Kiwanis Music Festival a total of 3 times (once per year) and received 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes on serveral occasions, even making it to provincials, Ontario Music Festival Association (OMFA).
