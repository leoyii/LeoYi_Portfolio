            <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
            <p>I am a proud member of the Mackenzie Science Club, Linguistics Club, and Pokemon Club at our school.</p>
            <p>Some of my interests include: playing video games, chess, and reading.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I also enjoy watching anime, which is a type of japanese cartoon.</p>
            <p>I am also a keyboard hobbyist, which basically means I am into custom mechanical keyboards.</p>
